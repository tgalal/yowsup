Updates (December 30, 2017)
Yowsup v2.5.7 is out, See release notes

==========================================================

Yowsup opened WhatsApp service under platforms!
Yowsup is a Python library that enables you to build applications which use the WhatsApp service. Yowsup has been used to create two clients: 1) An unofficial WhatsApp client Nokia N9 through the Wazapp project which was in use by more than 200K users; 2) Another fully featured unofficial client for Blackberry 10.

Quickstart
yowsup's architecture
Create a sample app
yowsup-cli
Yowsup development, debugging, maintainance and sanity
Installation
Requires python2.6+, or python3.0 +
Required python packages: python-dateutil,
Required python packages for end-to-end encryption: protobuf, pycrypto, python-axolotl-curve25519
Required python packages for yowsup-cli: argparse, readline (or pyreadline for windows), pillow (for sending images)
Install using setup.py to pull all Python dependencies, or pip:

pip install yowsup2
Linux
You need to have installed Python headers (probably from python-dev package) and ncurses-dev, then run

python setup.py install
Because of a bug with python-dateutil package you might get permission error for some dateutil file called requires.txt when you use yowsup (see this bug report) to fix you'll need to chmod 644 that file.

FreeBSD (*BSD)
You need to have installed: py27-pip-7.1.2(+), py27-sqlite3-2.7.11_7(+), then run

pip install yowsup2
Mac
python setup.py install
Administrators privileges might be required, if so then run with 'sudo'

Windows
Install mingw compiler
Add mingw to your PATH
In PYTHONPATH\Lib\distutils create a file called distutils.cfg and add these lines:
[build]
compiler=mingw32
Install gcc: mingw-get.exe install gcc
Install zlib
python setup.py install
If pycrypto fails to install with some "chmod error". You can install it separately using something like easy_install http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/pycrypto26/pycrypto-2.6.win32-py2.7.exe

or for python3 from:

https://github.com/axper/python3-pycrypto-windows-installer

and then rerun the install command again
