==========================================================

## Yowsup opened WhatsApp service under platforms!

Yowsup is a python library that enables you build application which use WhatsApp service. Yowsup has been used to create an unofficial WhatsApp client Nokia N9 through the Wazapp project which was in use by 200K + users as well as another fully featured unofficial client for Blackberry 10

## Quickstart

 * **[yowsup's architecture](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/Architecture)**
 * **[Create a sample app](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/Sample-Application)**
 * **[yowsup-cli](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/yowsup-cli-2.0)**
 * **[Yowsup development, debugging, maintainance and sanity](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/wiki/Yowsup-development,-debugging,-maintainance-and-sanity)**

## Installation

 - Requires python2.6+, or python3.0 +
 - Required python packages: python-dateutil,
 - Required python packages for end-to-end encryption: protobuf, pycrypto, python-axolotl-curve25519
 - Required python packages for yowsup-cli: argparse, readline (or pyreadline for windows), pillow (for sending images)

Install using setup.py to pull all python dependencies, or using pip:

```
pip install yowsup2
```

### Linux

You need to have installed python headers (from probably python-dev package) and ncurses-dev, then run
```
python setup.py install
```
Because of a bug with python-dateutil package you might get permission error for some dateutil file called requires.txt when you use yowsup (see [this bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/dateutil/+bug/1243202)) to fix you'll need to chmod 644 that file.

### FreeBSD (*BSD)
You need to have installed: py27-pip-7.1.2(+), py27-sqlite3-2.7.11_7(+), then run
```
pip install yowsup2
```

### Mac
```
python setup.py install
```
Administrators privileges might be required, if so then run with 'sudo'

### Windows

 - Install [mingw](http://www.mingw.org/) compiler
 - Add mingw to your PATH
 - In PYTHONPATH\Lib\distutils create a file called distutils.cfg and add these lines:

```
[build]
compiler=mingw32
```
 - Install gcc: ```mingw-get.exe install gcc```
 - Install [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/)
 - ```python setup.py install```

If pycrypto fails to install with some "chmod error". You can install it separately using something like
```easy_install http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/pycrypto26/pycrypto-2.6.win32-py2.7.exe```

or for python3 from:

 > [https://github.com/axper/python3-pycrypto-windows-installer](https://github.com/axper/python3-pycrypto-windows-installer)

and then rerun the install command again
