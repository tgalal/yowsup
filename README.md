---

yowsup is a python library that enables building applications that can communicate with WhatsApp users.
The project started as the protocol engine behind [Wazapp for Meego](https://wiki.maemo.org/Wazapp) and
[OpenWA for BB10](https://www.lowyat.net/2013/5896/try-this-openwhatsapp-for-blackberry-10/). Now as a standalone
library it can be used to power any custom WhatsApp client.

## See also

During maintenance of yowsup, several projects have been spawned in order to support different features that get
introduced by WhatsApp. Some of those features are not necessarily exclusive to WhatsApp and therefore it only made
sense to maintain some parts as standalone projects:

- [python-axolotl](https://github.com/tgalal/python-axolotl): Python port of
[libsignal-protocol-java](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java), providing E2E encryption
- [consonance](https://github.com/tgalal/consonance/): WhatsApp's handshake implementation using Noise Protocol
- [dissononce](https://github.com/tgalal/dissononce):  A python implementation for
[Noise Protocol Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/)
